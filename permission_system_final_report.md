## Executive Summary

The permission system enhancement project has successfully implemented a more granular and flexible permission structure across all features of the furious plugin. The new system replaces general administrative permissions with specific, targeted permissions, introduces a structured permission inheritance system, and improves integration between different features.

This report summarizes the implemented enhancements, highlights integration points between different systems, suggests potential future improvements, and provides migration guidance for server administrators and plugin developers.

## Implemented Enhancements

### Granular Permissions

The most significant enhancement is the replacement of general administrative permissions with more granular, specific permissions:

| Feature | Old Permission | New Granular Permissions |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Wallet | `furious.wallet.admin` | `furious.wallet.balance.others`, `furious.wallet.add`, `furious.wallet.sub`, `furious.wallet.set` |
| Bank | `furious.bank.editbalance` | `furious.bank.add`, `furious.bank.subtract`, `furious.bank.set` |
| Bank | `furious.bank.editbalance.others` | `furious.bank.add.others`, `furious.bank.subtract.others`, `furious.bank.set.others` |
| Guild | `furious.guild.admin` | `furious.guild.admin.transfer`, `furious.guild.admin.unclaim`, `furious.guild.admin.homes`, `furious.guild.admin.disband`, `furious.guild.admin.info` |
| Homes | `furious.homes.admin` | `furious.homes.set.others`, `furious.homes.delete.others`, `furious.homes.move.others`, `furious.homes.rename.others`, `furious.homes.tp.others`, `furious.homes.list.others` |
| Warps | `furious.warps.admin` | `furious.warps.create.others`, `furious.warps.delete.others`, `furious.warps.relocate.others`, `furious.warps.rename.others`, `furious.warps.cost.others`, `furious.warps.passwd.others` |
| Tombstones | `furious.tombstones.admin` | `furious.tombstones.purge`, `furious.tombstones.purge.others`, `furious.tombstones.access.others`, `furious.tombstones.extend.others`, `furious.tombstones.teleport.others` |

This granular approach allows server administrators to assign specific permissions to different staff roles, providing more precise control over what actions staff members can perform.

### Permission Inheritance System

A structured permission inheritance system has been implemented, where higher-level permissions automatically grant related lower-level permissions:

1. **Wildcard Permissions**: Permissions ending with `.*` grant all child permissions
   - Example: `furious.guild.*` grants all guild-related permissions
   - Example: `furious.bank.admin.*` grants all administrative bank permissions

2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Permissions are organized in a hierarchical structure
   - Top level: Feature category (e.g., `furious.guild`, `furious.bank`)
   - Second level: Operation type (e.g., `furious.guild.admin`, `furious.bank.add`)
   - Third level: Target specification (e.g., `furious.bank.add.others`)

3. **Automatic Inheritance**: Higher-level permissions automatically grant lower-level permissions
   - If a player has `furious.homes.*.others`, they automatically have all permissions like `furious.homes.set.others`, `furious.homes.delete.others`, etc.
   - If a player has `furious.teleport.admin.*`, they automatically have permissions like `furious.teleport.worldconfig`, `furious.teleport.coords`, etc.

This inheritance system simplifies permission management while still allowing for granular control when needed.

### Documentation Updates

Comprehensive documentation has been created to support the enhanced permission system:

1. **Permission Analysis Documents**: Detailed analysis of each feature's permissions, including current state, implemented enhancements, and future considerations.

2. **Admin Guides**: Updated admin guides for each feature with detailed explanations of the new granular permissions and inheritance system.

3. **Player Guides**: Updated player guides with simplified explanations of how permissions affect gameplay.

4. **Comprehensive Permission Reference**: A central reference document listing all permissions, their descriptions, default values, and inheritance relationships.

5. **Permission Testing Guide**: A guide for testing the permission system, including manual procedures, automated approaches, and specific test scenarios.

### Integration Improvements

The permission system now better integrates with other systems:

1. **Economic Integration**: Enhanced integration between wallet, bank, and shop permissions for a unified economic experience.

2. **Teleportation Integration**: Unified permission-based restrictions across teleport, homes, and warps systems.

3. **Guild Role-Permission Integration**: Improved integration between guild roles and server permissions, with clear documentation of how they interact.

## Integration Points

### Economic Systems Integration

The economic systems (wallet, bank, shops) now share a unified permission structure:

1. **Wallet-Bank Integration**:
   - `furious.bank.withdraw.auto` allows automatic withdrawals from bank when wallet has insufficient funds
   - `furious.wallet.bypass.cost` allows bypassing costs across all economic features

2. **Wallet-Shop Integration**:
   - Shop transactions verify permissions through the wallet system
   - Permission-based transaction limits apply consistently across wallet and shop systems

3. **Bank-Shop Integration**:
   - Permission-based interest rates and account limits
   - Consistent economic rules based on permission levels

### Teleportation Systems Integration

The teleportation systems (teleport, homes, warps) now share consistent permission-based restrictions:

1. **Unified Bypass Permissions**:
   - `furious.teleport.admin` bypasses restrictions across all teleportation systems
   - `furious.teleport.bypass.cooldown` and `furious.teleport.bypass.cost` work consistently

2. **Consistent Cooldowns and Costs**:
   - Permission-based cooldowns (e.g., `furious.teleport.cooldown.X`) apply consistently
   - Permission-based costs work the same way across all teleportation features

3. **World Restrictions**:
   - World teleportation settings apply consistently across all teleportation systems
   - Permission-based exceptions work the same way for all teleportation types

### Guild Role-Permission Integration

The guild system now features enhanced integration between guild roles and server permissions:

1. **Role-Permission Checks**:
   - Permission checks consider both the player's server permissions and their role within the guild
   - Documentation clearly explains how these two systems interact

2. **Hierarchical Roles**:
   - Guild roles (Owner, Officer, Member) have corresponding permission sets
   - Higher roles automatically include permissions from lower roles

3. **Configurable Integration**:
   - Server administrators can customize which permissions are granted to each guild role
   - Documentation provides examples of common configurations

### Code Implementation Requirements

The following code changes are required to fully implement the enhanced permission system:

1. **Command Handler Updates**: ⚠️
   - Update command handlers to check for new granular permissions
   - Add fallbacks to legacy permissions for backward compatibility
   - Example: In `HomesCommand.java`, check for `furious.homes.set.others` first, then fall back to `furious.homes.admin`

2. **plugin.yml Updates**: ⚠️
   - Register all new permissions in the plugin.yml file
   - Include descriptions and default values for each permission

3. **Permission Inheritance Enhancement**: ⚠️
   - The current `Permission.matches()` method only supports one level of wildcard inheritance
   - Consider enhancing to support multi-level inheritance if needed

## Future Improvements

### Enhanced Wildcard Matching

The current implementation of wildcard matching in the `Permission.matches()` method only supports basic wildcard matching at the end of permission nodes. Future improvements could include:

1. **Multi-Level Inheritance**: Enhance the `Permission.matches()` method to support multi-level inheritance, allowing permissions like `furious.*` to grant all permissions that start with "furious.".

2. **Middle Wildcards**: Add support for wildcards in the middle of permission nodes, allowing patterns like `furious.*.admin` to match permissions like `furious.bank.admin` and `furious.guild.admin`.

3. **Pattern Matching**: Implement more sophisticated pattern matching for permissions, potentially using regular expressions for complex patterns.

### Permission Caching

To improve performance, especially with many permissions and users, a permission caching system could be implemented:

1. **Result Caching**: Cache the results of permission checks to avoid recalculating for frequently checked permissions.

2. **Invalidation Strategy**: Implement a cache invalidation strategy to ensure cached results are updated when permissions change.

3. **Configurable Caching**: Allow administrators to configure caching behavior based on their server's needs.

### GUI-Based Permission Management

A graphical user interface for permission management would make it easier for administrators to configure permissions:

1. **Permission Browser**: Create a GUI that allows browsing and searching for permissions.

2. **Role Editor**: Provide a visual editor for creating and managing roles.

3. **Player Permission Management**: Allow administrators to view and edit player permissions through a GUI.

4. **Inheritance Visualization**: Visually represent permission inheritance relationships to make them easier to understand.

### Permission Presets

Predefined permission presets would simplify initial setup and common configuration changes:

1. **Server Type Presets**: Create permission presets for different types of servers (e.g., survival, creative, RPG, economy-focused).

2. **Staff Role Presets**: Define common staff role presets (e.g., admin, moderator, helper) with appropriate permissions.

3. **Feature-Specific Presets**: Provide presets for specific features or gameplay styles.

4. **Custom Preset Creation**: Allow administrators to create and share their own permission presets.

## Migration Guide

### For Server Administrators

If you're updating from an older version of the plugin, follow these steps to migrate to the new permission system:

1. **Update Permission Plugins**:
   - Ensure your permission plugin supports wildcard permissions and permission inheritance.
   - Popular options include LuckPerms, PermissionsEx, and GroupManager.

2. **Replace Legacy Permissions**:
   - Replace general administrative permissions with their granular equivalents:
     - `furious.wallet.admin` → `furious.wallet.balance.others`, `furious.wallet.add`, etc.
     - `furious.homes.admin` → `furious.homes.set.others`, `furious.homes.delete.others`, etc.
     - See the [Migration Guide](#migration-guide) in the permission reference for a complete list.

3. **Use Permission Inheritance**:
   - Instead of assigning many individual permissions, use wildcard permissions:
     - `furious.wallet.admin.*` instead of individual administrative wallet permissions
     - `furious.bank.admin.*` instead of individual administrative bank permissions

4. **Update Staff Roles**:
   - Review and update staff role permissions to take advantage of the new granular system.
   - Consider creating more specialized roles with specific permissions.

5. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Use the testing procedures in the Permission Testing Guide to verify your configuration.
   - Pay special attention to legacy permissions and inheritance.

### For Plugin Developers

If you're developing plugins that integrate with furious, follow these guidelines:

1. **Check for Granular Permissions First**:
   - Check for specific granular permissions before falling back to legacy permissions.
   - Example:

```
if (player.hasPermission("furious.homes.set.others") || player.hasPermission("furious.homes.admin")) {
    // Allow the action
}
```

2. **Support Permission Inheritance**:
   - Don't rely on players having specific permissions; they might have them through inheritance.
   - Test with both specific permissions and wildcard permissions.

3. **Document Permissions Clearly**:
   - Follow the established naming patterns for new permissions.
   - Document default values and inheritance relationships.

4. **Integrate with Existing Systems**:
   - Use the same permission-based restrictions across related features.
   - Maintain consistency with the existing permission structure.

## Conclusion

The enhanced permission system provides a more flexible, granular, and intuitive way to manage permissions in the furious plugin. By replacing general administrative permissions with specific, targeted permissions and implementing a structured inheritance system, server administrators now have more precise control over what actions players and staff can perform.

The comprehensive documentation, including detailed guides, reference materials, and testing procedures, ensures that administrators can effectively use and maintain the permission system. The integration improvements between different features create a more consistent and unified experience across the plugin.

While there are still some code implementation requirements to fully realize these enhancements, the groundwork has been laid for a significantly improved permission system that will benefit both administrators and players.
