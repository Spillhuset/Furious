# Security Audit Report for Furious Plugin

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a security audit conducted on the Furious Minecraft plugin. The audit identified several security vulnerabilities, primarily related to permission handling in certain commands. These vulnerabilities have been addressed with appropriate fixes. The plugin is now more secure and follows best practices for permission management.

## Identified Issues and Fixes

### 1. Missing Permission Checks in Commands

**Issue**: Several commands did not properly check for permissions before executing sensitive operations.

**Affected Components**:
- `InvseeCommand`: Allowed any player to view another player's inventory without permission checks
- `EnderseeCommand`: Allowed any player to view another player's enderchest without permission checks

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added permission checks to both commands
- Added permission definitions to `plugin.yml`
- Set default permission level to "op" for these sensitive operations

### 2. Unsafe Offline Player Data Access

**Issue**: The `EnderseeCommand` attempted to access offline player data in an unsafe manner, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Disabled the feature for security and stability reasons
- Added clear error messaging to inform users

### 3. Missing Self-Check in Inventory Commands

**Issue**: Players could use inventory viewing commands on themselves, which is unnecessary and could cause confusion.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added checks to prevent players from using these commands on themselves
- Added helpful messages suggesting alternative commands

## Security Best Practices Observed

The plugin already follows several security best practices:

1. **Proper File Operations**: File paths are constructed securely using the plugin's data folder.
2. **Input Validation**: Most commands properly validate user input.
3. **Error Handling**: There is proper error handling with try-catch blocks and logging.
4. **Permission Structure**: The permission system is well-structured with appropriate defaults.
5. **Subcommand Pattern**: Complex commands use a subcommand pattern with proper permission checking.

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Consistent Permission Checking**: Implement a consistent approach to permission checking across all commands, possibly by extending the SubCommand interface for standalone commands.

2. **Audit Logging**: Consider implementing more detailed audit logging for sensitive operations like inventory viewing.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for commands that could be abused.

4. **Regular Security Reviews**: Conduct regular security reviews as the plugin evolves.

## Conclusion

The Furious plugin is now more secure after addressing the identified vulnerabilities. By implementing proper permission checks and fixing unsafe code, the plugin better protects server resources and player data. The recommendations provided will help maintain and improve security as the plugin continues to develop.
