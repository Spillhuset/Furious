# Security Review Process for Furious Plugin

This document outlines the process for conducting regular security reviews of the Furious plugin. Regular security reviews are essential to ensure that the plugin remains secure as it evolves and new features are added.

## Schedule

Security reviews should be conducted at least once every 90 days (quarterly). The SecurityReviewManager automatically tracks when the last review was conducted and when the next one is due. Server administrators with the `furious.security.admin` permission will be notified when a security review is due.

## Review Process

### 1. Preparation

Before conducting a security review, gather the following information:

- List of changes made to the plugin since the last review
- Any security incidents or reports
- Current version of the plugin and Minecraft server
- List of dependencies and their versions

### 2. Code Review

Review the codebase for security vulnerabilities, focusing on:

- **Permission Checks**: Ensure all commands and sensitive operations have proper permission checks
- **Input Validation**: Verify that all user input is properly validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Check for proper error handling and logging
- **Resource Management**: Look for potential resource leaks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities
- **Data Storage**: Ensure sensitive data is stored securely
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Verify that authentication and authorization mechanisms are secure
- **Dependency Security**: Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### 3. Testing

Perform security testing to identify vulnerabilities:

- **Permission Testing**: Test that permission checks are working correctly
- **Input Validation Testing**: Test with malicious input to ensure proper validation
- **Error Handling Testing**: Test error conditions to ensure proper handling
- **Resource Management Testing**: Test resource-intensive operations to ensure proper management
- **Authentication and Authorization Testing**: Test authentication and authorization mechanisms

### 4. Documentation

Document the findings of the security review:

- **Vulnerabilities**: Document any vulnerabilities found, including severity, impact, and recommended fixes
- **Recommendations**: Document recommendations for improving security
- **Changes**: Document any changes made to address security issues

### 5. Implementation

Implement fixes for any vulnerabilities found:

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Fix immediately
- **High Severity Vulnerabilities**: Fix as soon as possible
- **Medium Severity Vulnerabilities**: Schedule for the next release
- **Low Severity Vulnerabilities**: Consider fixing in a future release

### 6. Verification

Verify that the fixes address the vulnerabilities:

- **Testing**: Test the fixes to ensure they address the vulnerabilities
- **Code Review**: Review the code changes to ensure they are correct and don't introduce new vulnerabilities

### 7. Completion

Mark the security review as completed:

1. Use the `/security review complete [notes]` command to mark the review as completed
2. The SecurityReviewManager will automatically schedule the next review

## Commands

The following commands are available for managing security reviews:

- `/security status`: Show the status of security reviews (last review date, next review date, etc.)
- `/security review complete [notes]`: Mark a security review as completed with optional notes
- `/security review interval <days>`: Set the interval between security reviews in days
- `/security help`: Show help for security commands

## Permissions

The following permissions are available for security commands:

- `furious.security.admin`: Allows managing security reviews and other security-related tasks

## Automated Notifications

The SecurityReviewManager automatically notifies administrators when a security review is due:

- **Server Log**: A warning message is logged to the server log
- **In-Game Notification**: Administrators with the `furious.security.admin` permission are notified in-game when they join the server
- **Daily Check**: The SecurityReviewManager checks daily if a security review is due

## Security Review Checklist

Use the following checklist when conducting a security review:

### Permission Checks

- [ ] All commands have proper permission checks
- [ ] All sensitive operations have proper permission checks
- [ ] Permission hierarchy is properly structured
- [ ] Default permission levels are appropriate

### Input Validation

- [ ] All user input is properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] Input validation is consistent across the plugin
- [ ] Input validation handles edge cases properly

### Error Handling

- [ ] All errors are properly caught and handled
- [ ] Error messages are informative but don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Errors are properly logged

### Resource Management

- [ ] Resources are properly acquired and released
- [ ] Resource limits are enforced where appropriate
- [ ] Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse

### Data Storage

- [ ] Sensitive data is stored securely
- [ ] Data is properly validated before storage
- [ ] Data is properly validated after retrieval

### Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Authentication mechanisms are secure
- [ ] Authorization checks are properly implemented
- [ ] Privilege escalation is not possible

### Dependency Security

- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Dependencies don't have known security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependency usage is secure

## Conclusion

Regular security reviews are essential to ensure that the Furious plugin remains secure as it evolves. By following this process, you can identify and address security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
